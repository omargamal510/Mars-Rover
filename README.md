Mars Rover Project

Welcome to the Mars Rover Project! This project is a simulation of a Mars Rover that navigates a hypothetical Martian terrain. Developed using procedural programming in JavaScript, this project adheres to the principles of separation of concerns, an essential aspect of the SOLID principles, ensuring that each part of the codebase handles a distinct aspect of the rover's functionality. This approach enhances maintainability, scalability, and understandability of the code.
